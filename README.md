WebOS-Github
===
The (as far as I know) first Github app for WebOS (Palm Pre and Pixi) ever.

Note, that this app will likely distributed as a paid app in palms app-shop, when its not under development anymore.
However, you can still download the source, build your own package, install it via QuickInstall and use it for free.
